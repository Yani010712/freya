The Freya Project is an initiative that aims to educate and promote awareness on the environmental and financial cost of using single use menstrual care products. 

Our quiz helps women choose the best menstrual cups for them based on a small series of questions. A database has been created with a manually compiled list of products that will be presented together with links to the corresponding brands’ sites. The site also includes a news API with current events focused on women’s menstrual health worldwide. It features hand selected articles with information on how to use the cups and how to properly care for them. Our favorite component is the Period Calculator. It provides the financial break down on how much money users save both yearly and in their lifetimes when choosing menstrual cups over disposable menstrual products.

A future feature will include a "Buy One Give One" and Donations page. It will explain and show the partnership between the brands who's sites we redirect our users to and organizations that provide free cups to girls in developing countries. This page will contain a Google Maps API that will show the nations that are in need the most of reusable menstrual care products. We also want to provide a page that can keep and display tips and reviews by users. Also accurate translations to the most spoken languages world-wide, a currency converter, FAQs, and coupons.
